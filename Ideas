Ideas:
    Have levels serve a secondary purpose as call backs to previous boss battles
    
    Have the story flow through the same lineage and stick
    
    Stick presents itself, or puts itself in the way of someone who needs it 
    
    How is stick fashioned between different time periods?

Level Ideas:
    1. The player must slay a mythical creature during the dawn of man using a stick with an unknown backstory 
    (EG: the Nemean lion(killed by Heracles))

    2. During Khan age Subutai uses a Mongolian death worm (spawns multiple smaller worms who drop health & other items) which you playing as Alauddin Khalji must kill, using destructable terrain to find new ways to attack. (Hallow knight difficulty but less chance of dieing) (Callback to Terranigma parasite battle)

    3. Play as Minamoto no Yoshitsune or Tomoe Gozen using a bokuto figthing a Shikigami who spawns multiple weak enemies (Hallow knight difficulty) (Callback to Doom boss fights)
    
    4.  Abraham lincoln vampire hunter scenariono where play as influential leader during large scale war who fights off the leader of a vampire army 
    
    5. During WW2/Vietnam war, stick fashioned into gun or melee weapon which is used to defeat a grandious enemy
